//Write a Java program that takes the purchase amount as input and calculates the final
//payable amount after applying the discount.
//1. If the purchase amount is less than 500, no discount is applied.
//2. If the purchase amount is between 500 and 1000, a 10% discount is applied.
//3. If the purchase amount is greater than 1000 a 20% discount is applied.
